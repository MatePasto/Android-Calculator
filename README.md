# Android-Calculator
## Calculator made for android devices with Android Studio.

---

This is my first app made with android studio. The idea with this was to test and learn about android development, and it was not meant to be a very complex app, just somthing to learn and get better in the subject. In the future i plan to add more operations and use a frontend framework.

#### Version: Alpha 1.0.1

(The layout is done entirely in native XML yet)
