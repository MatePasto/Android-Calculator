### Calculator made for android devices with Android Studio.

This is my first app made with android studio. The idea with this was to test and learn about android development, and it was not meant to be a very complex app, just somthing to learn and get better in the subject.

### Version: Alpha 1.0.0

- Created base frontend/backend structure and base math operators.
- It only can do one operation per use (To Do: Reset() Function).
- The structure of backend it uses lots of ifs and doesn't have much classes (To Do: Refactor so it has more classes).
